Firefish is a simple yet powerful **rule-based firewall** and **network monitor** built in Python.  
It allows you to define rules for **IP, ports, and protocols**, monitor traffic in real time, and optionally enforce rules with **iptables**.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Rule-based allow/deny for IPs, ports, and protocols  
- Live packet sniffing with [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) for monitoring/logging  
- Optional system-level enforcement using **iptables** (Linux only)  
- Command-line interface (CLI) + optional Tkinter GUI for live view and control  
- Rotating logs and simple **JSON/YAML rule files**  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements (Linux)
- Python **3.8+**  
- [scapy](https://pypi.org/project/scapy/) ‚Üí `sudo pip install scapy`  
- [pyyaml](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) ‚Üí `sudo pip install pyyaml` (optional, for YAML configs)  
- Root privileges (needed for packet sniffing and iptables changes)  

---

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Monitor only (no iptables changes), using default rules file:
```bash
sudo python firefish.py --iface eth0
```

Enforce rules via iptables + monitor:
```bash
sudo python firefish.py --iface eth0 --enforce
```

Use a specific rules file:
```bash
sudo python firefish.py --config /path/to/my_rules.yaml --iface wlan0 --enforce

Launch the GUI:
```bash
sudo python firefish.py --iface eth0 --gui


üìú Rules File Format (YAML)

Example firefish_rules.yaml:

# Default policy if no rules match
default_policy: ALLOW   # or DENY

rules:
  - action: DENY
    direction: IN       # IN | OUT | BOTH
    proto: TCP          # TCP | UDP | ICMP | ANY
    src_ip: ANY
    dst_ip: 192.168.1.100
    dst_port: 22        # block inbound SSH to this host

  - action: DENY
    direction: OUT
    proto: UDP
    dst_port: 53        # block outbound DNS

  - action: ALLOW
    direction: BOTH
    proto: ANY
    dst_ip: 8.8.8.8
    dst_port: 443       # allow traffic to Google DNS over HTTPS

  - action: DENY
    direction: BOTH
    proto: ANY
    src_ip: 10.0.0.0/8  # block private source subnet

  - action: ALLOW
    direction: IN
    proto: TCP
    dst_port: 3389
    label: SUSPICIOUS   # suspicious criteria ‚Üí logged at WARNING level

üëâ Order matters: First matching rule applies. If no rule matches, the default policy applies.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/firefish-firewall.git
cd firefish-firewall

Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/start_firefish.sh scripts/stop_firefish.sh

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage (Scripts)
Start Firefish
```bash
./scripts/start_firefish.sh
```
‚úÖ Disables UFW (if running) and starts Firefish.

Stop Firefish
```bash
./scripts/stop_firefish.sh
```
‚úÖ Flushes Firefish rules and re-enables UFW.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Firefish is intended for educational and personal use.

Use responsibly and at your own risk.

Root privileges are required for full functionality.

üìå TODO / Future Improvements

Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS)

Advanced GUI with rule management

Intrusion detection features (anomaly detection, alerts)
